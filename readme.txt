After spending a lot of time how to setup this project on a new mashine here are the steps:
1. clone the project from git to location of your choice
2. on android studio wizard screen select "open existing project", don not "import project from..."
    since it wont't create local.properties file with sdk location
3. it might work with "import..." too, but settings.gradle must be manually created I guess.
